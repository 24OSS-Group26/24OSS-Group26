**Applying Filters such as Mosaic to Photos with OpenCV**

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to the Group 26 term project for the **Open Source Software Course, 2024**, at **Gachon University**. Our project involves applying various filters, such as mosaic effects, to photos using OpenCV. Through this project, we aim to explore image processing techniques in an open-source context.

## Project Structure
This repository includes:
- **Source Code**: Python scripts in the `src` folder, where `main.py` allows users to select from a variety of filters and apply them to images.
- **Documentation**: Explanations of the applied filters and how to use the provided code.
- **Sample Images**: Example images demonstrating the filter effects.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/24OSS-Group26/24OSS-Group26.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 24OSS-Group26
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required libraries (Python 3.12 and OpenCV):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**  
   Navigate to the `src` folder and run `main.py` to start applying filters:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python main.py
   ```

## Features
- **Mosaic Filter**: Apply a pixelation effect to blur parts or all of an image.
- **Additional Filters**: Explore more effects such as grayscale, sepia, and more.

## Usage
Run the `main.py` script in the `src` folder to select and apply various filters to images. Follow the instructions in the script for filter selection and intensity adjustment.
